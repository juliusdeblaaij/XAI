as a developer i would like to be able to configure which exceptions thrown by a module should be retryable within the rabbitmessagebus as usual these should be configurable at the bus andor stream deployment property level also consider disabling retry for kryo deserialization problems ---- we are running spring xd with rabbitmq transport and wed like to have a way to stop retries in certain situations in spring xd 120rc1 docshttpdocsspringioautorepodocsspring-xd120rc1referencehtml in chapter about rabbitmq transport in a note about retry section its written quotemessage deliveries failing with a messageconversionexception perhaps when using a custom converterclassname are never retried the assumption being that if a message could not be converted on the first attempt subsequent attempts will also failquote following is unclear are we speaking about orgspringframeworkmessagingconvertermessageconversionexception or orgspringframeworkamqpsupportconvertermessageconversionexception based on xd-1597 and amqp-390 its the latter only orgspringframeworkmessagingconvertermessageconversionexception is available for custom module developers attempting to throw orgspringframeworkamqpsupportconvertermessageconversionexception which is provided by xdhomelibmessagebusrabbitspring-amqp-145releasejar results in javalangclassnotfoundexception even after spring xd is configured to use rabbit transport throwing orgspringframeworkmessagingconvertermessageconversionexception from custom processor module written with spring integrations transformer or service-activator doesnt stop retries,5
as a user id like to have the option of editing the deployedundeployed stream so that i dont have to destroy to just change any deployment property,8
as a minimum we need some common polling strategy on the client side to detect status changes of job streams etc eg during deployment of streamsjobs ideally i would like to have this addressed on the server-side as well it would be nice if we could propagate events between containers and admin-server that would inform about any changes in the system we could then use those to notify connected ui clients,3

as a user id like to have the option of basic auth so that im challenged to provide user name and password when making a request technical implementation this functionality is provided in spring boot 11x it should be a matter of adding the spring boot security starter dependency to the spring-xd-dirt project it will be controlled using the spring boot property serverbasicenabled truefalse our default in applicationyml for this property should be false,1
as a user id like to have the description for each of the modules so that i can use it to understand the module purpose and its capabilities presumably what is captured in javadoc for the module definition,8
